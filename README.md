# ADHD Task manager
The following project is a Vue3 + Supabase hybrid application (mobile + web).
Enabling well-structured and semi-automated self task managing that uses several task planning techniques,
ensuring the best performance and efficiency, keeping it digitilized at the same time. 

## Used task planning techniques
### 1. Ive Lee Rules
    1. Plan from 3 to 6 tasks to do for the next day
    2. Make your planning at the evening of the previous day - in order to avoid stacking your work day with decision making process.
    3. Put tasks in the importance order (from most important to the least).
    4. Tasks you have not managed to complete are passed to the next day.
    5. 

### 2. Eisenhower Matrix
Important & Urgent - Start with them
Not Important & Urgent - Schedule
Important & Not Urgent - Postpone
Not Important & Not Urgent - Eliminate (?)

### 3. Chronotypes and efficiency hours
Everyone operates in their own indiviual internal clock, called chrontype.
Based on the chrontype it is possible to find the most optimal working hours.

However, chronotypes also inform us about best time for different type of tasks:
- analytical - requiring deep focus and minimal amount of distractions
- common - usually connected to repeated or more simple tasks like mailing, noting, reading
- abstract - connected to creativity and abstract thinking. These kind of objectives can be resolved, sometimes in random parts of the day or situations.

Despite the statistical data of the chronotypes, it is extremely important to monitor own productivity hours. 
In order to do that, **daily notepad** could become a **feature**.

### 4. Power of habits
Tasks are only a part of increasing productivity. In order to boost that it is highly recommended to build own working habits. This project might implement similar solutions used by "Habitica" (by gamification).

## ADHD requirements
